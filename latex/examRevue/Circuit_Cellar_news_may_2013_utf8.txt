SERIAL DATA ACQUISITION SOFTWARE FOR WINDOWS 7
The data acquisition and control software suite for Windows 7 (64-and 32-bit), Vista, and XP can be used to read and control up to 10 devices over
RS-232, RS-422, RS-485, and Modbus. Windmill software includes ready-to-run applications that can be used to chart and log data, control analog and digital outputs,
monitor the COM port, and send data directly to Excel. The software’s COM port monitoring program, ComDebug, enables you to see all sent and received bytes including
non-printing characters, such as carriage returns.
This can be critical when managing binary data. You can control the state of the PC’s serial port output lines and see the state of the input lines. ComDebug sends 16-bit
two’s complement integers, unsigned integers, single bits of data, and ASCII values to instruments. Windmill software works with instruments communicating with ASCII or binary
messages. It can collect readings from the majority of serial instruments that can be plugged into the computer’s COM port, including PICs, power meters, digital
indicators, multimeters, data loggers, GPS receivers, gyro compasses, motion sensors, and laboratory scales. You can mix and match equipment from many different
manufacturers in many combinations. The software suite costs . The price
includes lifetime technical support and a money-back guarantee.

WIDE VOLTAGE SERIAL AND PARALLEL F-RAM
Devices in the are available in serial I2C, SPI, and parallel communication interfaces, with an operating voltage range of 2.7 to 5.5 V.
Performance enhancements include a 25% to 50% reduction in active current requirements and serial devices with faster power-up initialization.
The FM24W256 and FM25W256 W-Family memories are available in 256-Kb serial I2C and SPI, respectfully. The 64-Kb FM16W08 and 256-Kb FM18W08
devices feature a parallel communication interface.
W-Family products are built on an advanced, ferroelectric process. They offer NoDelay writes, 100-trillion high-endurance read/write cycles, and 38-year data
retention. The memories are available in industry-standard “green” packaging that includes an eight-pin SOIC for serial devices and a 28-pin SOIC for parallel
devices. The W-Family is ideal for nonvolatile memory applications that require frequent or rapid writes or low-power operation. W-Family serial SPI devices offer
full-bus speed writes and can operate over the industrial temperature range of –40°C to 85°C.
The FM24W256 and FM25W256 memories cost in 10,000- piece quantities. The parallel devices cost for the FM16W08 and for the FM18W08.
